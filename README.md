Conception:
One day I was driving and I went over a large pothole, causing damage to my car. At the time I was researching machine learning technologies and a lightbulb lit up in my head. What if I could make myself aware of road hazards in a better way?

I was introduced to the details behind neural networks through a common problem, learning to categorize numbers through the MNIST dataset. Along with self study, this gave me an essential foundation to understanding the layers and connections in neural networks, the techniques of gradient descent and backpropagation, and the importance of the loss function in iteratively improving the model. Through this, I already understood that detecting irregularities in the road is possible and highly achievable with todays technology. 

Using this Colab Notebook, I trained several YOLO11 models on a publically available dataset of potholes and road damage. The result was a model that was able to pick out and identify potholes in the road. This model is able to function in real time.
